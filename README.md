----------------

This repository contains all scripts written during [Chi Hack Night](https://chihacknight.org) in the R Learning Group. The group is currently organized by Angela Li, R Spatial Advocate at the [Center for Spatial Data Science](https://spatial.uchicago.edu) at UChicago. I also founded [R-Ladies Chicago](https://rladieschicago.org) and love R!
